# Set GitHub status to weather at your location

Create `.env` file with:
1. `WEATHERAPICOM_API_KEY` API key for [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com). A free account is enough.
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN` [Personal access token (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with scope `user`. Please keep in mind that, in general, it's not safe to trust random software with tokens like that.
3. `LAT` and `LON` for a location. You can get it from Google Maps.
